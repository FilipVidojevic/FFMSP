# This test helps with understanding >lex operator (when one solution is better than another)
# Solutions ACGT and ACGA both have objective function equal to 2 (for t=2), since their
# distance to CATT and CAGT are >=2. But, ACGA >lex ACGT because ACGT is 'more distant' to
# CATT and CAGT than ACGA.
